# Multiple editing options

FireCMS allows you to edit the data in the database in both an **inline** table,
and in **dedicated forms**.

Inline editing is very useful when you want to quickly edit a few fields of a
document. For example, if you have a list of users, you can quickly edit the
name of the user by clicking on the name and editing it.

<video style={{maxWidth:"100%", margin:"16px 0px 32px", alignSelf:"center"}}
       loop autoPlay muted>
    <source src="/img/inline_table_editing.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

You can also edit the data in a dedicated form. This is useful when you want to
edit a lot of fields, or when you want to edit a field that is not shown in the
table.

:::tip
You can force the CMS to always open the form when editing a document by
setting the `inlineEditing` property to `false` in the collection configuration.

## Real-time updates

FireCMS uses Firestore as a backend, which is a **real time database**. This means
that any change in the database is reflected in the CMS in real time.
This is a very powerful feature that allows you to have a CMS that is always
up-to-date with the data in the database.

These updates will be reflected both in the table and in the edit form (as long
as you have not modified the specific field that was updated).

This allows you to move some of your logic to backend functions, or have
completely dynamic data, and still have a CMS that is always up-to-date.

There is a big benefit to using Firebase/Firestore as a backend for your CMS:
you can leverage all the advanced features that Google Cloud Platform offers,
such as **Cloud Functions**, **Cloud Storage**, **BigQuery**, etc.

## Data synchronization with an external service

> The power of Cloud functions

Let's see how FireCMS helps [MedicalMotion](https://medicalmotion.com/) to
synchronize the videos of the exercises they use in their platform with
Vimeo.

We use a **Cloud Function** to synchronize the videos with Vimeo. This function
is triggered every time a new video is uploaded to the database. We listen
to the `onWrite` event of the `videos` collection, and we check if the file
field has been modified.

If the file has been modified, we upload the file to Vimeo and we update the
database with the new video URL.

<img
    src="/img/video_sync.png"
    alt="Diagram of the video synchronization process"
    style={{
        width: "100%"
    }}/>

We leverage the **real time updates** of Firestore to update a `status` field
in the database. This field is used to show the status of the video in the
CMS. In can take values like `In progress`, `In sync`, `Error`, etc.

<video style={{maxWidth:"100%", margin:"16px 0px 32px", alignSelf:"center"}}
       loop autoPlay muted>
    <source src="/img/video_sync.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

> The `seconds` field in this video are also updated automatically in
> a separate step.

This is just an example of how you can use FireCMS to build a CMS that is
adaptable to your business logic. Serverless functions are a great way to
extend the functionalities offered by this project and make it even more
powerful.
