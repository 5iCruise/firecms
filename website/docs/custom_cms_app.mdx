FireCMS was originally developed to create Firebase/Firestore-based CMS apps
with very little effort. We offer sensible defaults and multiple customization
options and callbacks.

But there are a few situations where you may want to have more control and build
your app using the same components that we use internally.

In the process of having a cleaner code, all the code related to Firebase has
been isolated into 3 components, one for authentication (auth delegate), one
for the data source and one for storage. These components are abstracted away
behind their respective interfaces. This means you can replace any of those
services with your custom implementation!

For this reason we expose many of the components used internally, so you can
use them in your app and combine them with your code

Some top-level components that you will find useful (same ones as used
by `FirebaseCMSApp`):
- [`FireCMS`](api/functions/firecms)
- [`Scaffold`](api/variables/scaffold)
- [`NavigationRoutes`](api/variables/NavigationRoutes)
- [`SideDialogs`](api/functions/SideDialogs)
- [`useInitialiseFirebase`](api/functions/useinitialisefirebase)
- [`useFirebaseAuthController`](api/functions/useFirebaseAuthController)
- [`useFirebaseStorageSource`](api/functions/usefirebasestoragesource)
- [`useFirestoreDataSource`](api/functions/usefirestoredatasource)

You will also be responsible for initialising your MUI5 theme and your react-router
`Router`

You can see an example

### Example custom app

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../example/src/CustomCMSApp";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
