# FireCMS

> Awesome Firestore based headless CMS, developed by Camberi

FireCMS is a headless CMS and admin panel built by developers for developers. It
generates CRUD views based on your configuration. You define views that are
mapped to absolute or relative paths in your Firestore database, as well as
schemas for your entities.

The goal of this CMS is to generate collection and form views that bind nicely
to the Firestore collection/document model. We have built in many basic (and not
so basic) use cases; but FireCMS is build with extensibility in mind, so it is
easy to create your custom form fields, or your complete views.

Note that this is a full application, with routing enabled and not a simple
component.
